# Mr. Robot's Curated VS Code Extensions

To install my list of extensions, run the following command at terminal (WSL/Ubuntu if Windows):

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flynnwebdev/vscode-extensions/main/install.sh | sh
```

You may need to prefix with `sudo` if you get a permission error.

Once installed, if you want to use the icon set I use, then (in VSCode) go to `Settings > Themes > File Icon Theme` and select `Material Icon Theme`
